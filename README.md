# Lily's Portfolio – Scroll-Based One Page Portfolio

Welcome to my frontend portfolio built with ❤️ using:

- **Next.js (App Router)**
- **TypeScript**

## 🌐 Project Structure

This project follows a modular, scalable structure with an atomic design approach:

    /atoms          → Buttons, Typography, Icons
    /molecules      → Cards, Section Headers
    /organisms      → Hero, Projects, Contact sections
    /templates      → (Optional) page-level layouts
  /lib              → Utilities, hooks, constants
  /styles           → Global styles, animations
  /public           → Static files (e.g. images, background videos)
